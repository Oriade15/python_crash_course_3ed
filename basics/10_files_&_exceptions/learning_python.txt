    - strings
    - integers
    - boolean
    - floating numbers
    - lists
    - tuples
    - dictionaries
    - sets
- In Python, you can use conditional statements to that evaluate to True or False to execute logic
- In Python, you can use loops to execute logic repeatedly (with a condition)
- In Python, you can also declare functions and classes to encapsulate your code and make it easier to manage
